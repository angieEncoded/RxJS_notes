# observables
- a wrapper around a data source
  - mouse events
  - keyboard events
  - file uploads
  - http requests
- Lets us filter, sort, and coordinate data.
- We can observe the data omitted from a source
- Observers
  - Receive the data an observable emitted
    - This is a subscription
  - Multiple Observers can subscribe to an observable
- Creation operators
  - Creates new observables
- Pipeable operators
  - Takes an observable as input and outputs a new observable
- Pipeable Operators
  - Functions for transforming, filtering, and combining data
- Some noteable operators and their uses
  - switchMap
    - Stop working on the order and start working on the new order - only the latest will be completed
  - concatMap 
    - The order is added to a queue. 
    - Finish what you are working on
    - Once done, work on the next order
  - mergeMap
    - Work on all orders at the same time as soon as you are given them
  - exhaustMap
    - Ignore new orders and finish whatever orders you are working on
    - Once done you can accept new orders
